This is the R code of the paper, whose abstract is the following:

Global irrigation models (GIMs) estimate irrigation water withdrawals (IWW) based on several assumptions regarding which components of the irrigation system to include and how to represent them. Although uncertainty and sensitivity analysis can explore the effect of quantitative assumptions by varying parameters within plausible numerical ranges, many assumptions are qualitative or pragmatic and therefore escape traditional quantitative methods. As a result, a key source of uncertainty in GIM remains underexamined. Here we address this gap through an expert elicitation workshop involving eleven irrigation scientists and five irrigators, who assessed both the influence and the quality of the knowledge base (pedigree) of key assumptions across approximately 50 studies. Scientists identified assumptions on irrigated area, irrigation efficiency and water availability, particularly the use of single datasets, as primary drivers of global IWW. Both scientists and irrigators judged these assumptions to be highly influential but weak in pedigree, reflecting limited empirical support, practical constraints, multiple alternatives and low consensus. By linking the assumption influence to epistemic strength, this study evaluates overlooked uncertainties and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the assumptions behind global IWW assessments.
